\begin{abstract} 
Hardware support for transactional memory in the form of
transaction synchronization instruction set extensions has been introduced in
recent Intel processors \citep{tsx-intro}. These extensions provide 2 software
interfaces to define transaction regions : a flexible interface which allows us
to specific a fallback path to handle transaction failures (Restricted
Transactional Memory) and another backward compatible extension that is less
customisable (Hardware Lock Elision). We plan to utilise these hardware
primitives for concurrency control among transactions that operate on
multiple-keys in a key-value store.  The read and write sets of these
transactions are assumed to be static. The performance of these hardware
primitives will be compared against traditional pessimistic concurrency control
schemes.
